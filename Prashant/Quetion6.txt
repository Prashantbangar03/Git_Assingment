--force-with-lease is a safer option that will not overwrite any work on the remote branch.

use of =>
--force when you want overwrites a remote branch with your local branch.
-- force-with-lease when you dont want to overwrite local branch with remote.

scenario --force-with-lease is
        if more commits were added to the remote branch (by another team-member or coworker or what have you). It ensures you do not overwrite someone elses work by force pushing.

Force with lease gives you the flexibility to override new commits on your remote branch, whilst protecting your old commit history:
If you rebased and squashed/edited/created new commits, you will be able to update the remote branch.
If new commits are added to the remote branch (by some team member), this command would not update the remote branch (and not overwrite any work).
