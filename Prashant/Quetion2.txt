To begin, rename your current remote (most likely named origin) to a different name. I'd rename this to the name of the service you are using, such as github or bitbucket.

git remote rename origin github

You can then add the remote for your second remote repository, in this case, a BitBucket repository.

git remote add bitbucket

 git@bitbucket.org:username/example.git

Afterwards, you'll want to set up your origin remote to push to both of these. Issue the following command:

git config -e

You can then push to both repositories by issuing:

git push origin master

Or to a single one by issuing either of these commands:

git push github master
git push bitbucket master
